Discussion - AI assisted coding of craps simulation lab
I used the built-in copilot extension in VScode and asked it to inspect my solution and offer any improvements.
There were a few performance improvements that I hadn't considered, like moving the roll_dice() and display_dice() functions outside of the main game loop so that they aren't being redifined unnecessarily with every loop of the simulation.
Another performance improvement from the AI was to reduce the amount of print() statements, which were causing the program to execute very slowly due to it having to display several lines per iteration, totalling several million lines. This change makes sense but I feel like it also sort of removes most of the feedback that the user would want to see.
For this specific use as a simulator it would be more useful if I removed all the print() statements except for the final results table and win/loss rates because I already understand what the main game loop is doing so I don't really need the visual feedback for every iteration.
The AI recommended changing my "while (games < 1_000_000)" with a for loop, "for game in range(1_000_000)", this looks slightly better because it removes the need for my manually incrementing 'games' variable.
The AI also recommended I change my results table loop to instead loop directly over the dictionary's sorted keys. My solution was using another manually incrementing variable 'i', and using that value +1 to access the numbered integer keys of the results dictionary. I have a tendency to prefer using manual incrementing variables in loops due to my first experience with programming being a C# course where I first learned about for loops, foreach loops, and while loops. Python's for loops seem similar to C#'s foreach loop, whereas in C#, a for loop would typically have an incrementing variable like 'i' or 'j' depending on how many loops were being nested inside each other.
There were some pieces that I forgot to remove, like an unused parameter in the roll_dice() function that I added previously when I was struggling with scope for the 'roll_count' variable. I needed a variable that would count how many times the dice had been rolled, but only in the current game. That counter would need to reset for each game because I was using that counter to track which key-value pair I needed to update when the game reached some resolution. Eventually I did end up figuring out where to define that counter and how to increment it accurately (after many failed attempts lol).
